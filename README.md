`laravel-email-log` logs outgoing emails sent to your users.
If you use MailGun, you can also track deliveries, failures, opens and clicks.

## Installation

Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require tompec/laravel-email-log
```

If you use Laravel 5.5+, the package will register itself, otherwise, add this to your `config/app.php`

``` php
'providers' => [
    Tompec\EmailLog\EmailLogServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tompec\EmailLog\EmailLogServiceProvider"
```

Optional: edit the default configuration values in `email-log.php`.
```php
return [
    /*
     * This is the name of the table that will be created by the migration.
     */
    'table_name' => 'email_log',

    /*
     * The model that will be attached to the email logs.
     */
    'recipient_model' => \App\User::class,

    /*
     * This is the name of the column that the `recipient_model` uses to store the email address.
     */
    'recipient_email_column' => 'email',
];
```

Run the migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Optional: if you want to get all the email logs for your a user, add this to your `App\User.php` file (or the model you chose as your `recipient_model`):

```php
public function email_logs()
{
    return $this->morphMany(\Tompec\EmailLog\EmailLog::class, 'recipient');
}
```

Then you can do `App\User::find(1)->email_logs` to retreive all the emails that this user has received.
